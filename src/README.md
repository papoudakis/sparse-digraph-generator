Source code for reproducing the tables and the figures of the paper.

## Scripts
```
generators.py
```
This script contains functions for generating graphs. These generators are SDG, GDGNC, Bollobas and SEDGE.

```
optimize_generators.py
```
This script contains functions for finding the optimal parameters for the generative models that exist in generator.py file

```
experiment_graph_generator.py
```
This script computes the optimal parameters for each model and produces 100 generated graphs for each original graph. The result can be found in ../generated_graphs.

```
experiment_results.py
```
Script for computing the average KS and MSD for the in-degree and the out-degree distribution. The results can be found in Table 2 in our paper.

```
sdg_no_tuning.py
```
Script for generating graph and computing KS and MSD without tuning using the SDG model. The result can be found in Table 4.

```
plots.py
```
Script for generating figures of in-degree, out-degree and spectrum of the graph for the original one and thse generated by SDG, GDGNC, and Bollobas. You can see the plots in Figure 1 of the paper.

```
evolution_tuning_sedge.py
 ```
 Script for computing the optimal parameters for SEDGE. Then it generates 100 graphs for capturing the software evolution. Finally it computes the average KS and MSD between the original and the generated graphs. You can find the results in table 5.
