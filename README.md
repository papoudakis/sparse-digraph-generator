# Sparse Digraph Generator

This repo contains scripts for reproducing the experimental results of our paper: **A generative model for sparse, evolving digraphs**.

There are 4 available folder:

* **src**, which contains the source code for the experiments

* **graphs**, which contains the 10 graphs we used for testing SDG in our experiments

* **generated_graphs**, which contains the 100 generated graphs for each one of the original graph for the 3 models that we tested, SDG, GDGNC, Bollobas

* **evolved_graphs**, which contains the 10 pairs of consecutive software graphs. We used this data for the experiments of SEDGE.
